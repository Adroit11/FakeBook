This is a Node.js application.

Run 'npm install' to be sure all modules are installed (you may need admin privilages or 'sudo').

To start the app run 'sails lift' in the root directory.

The app will be running on localhost, port 1337 (localhost:1337 or 127.0.0.1:1337).

You will need an internet connection for this app to function as it needs to connect to google's CloudSQL service.
